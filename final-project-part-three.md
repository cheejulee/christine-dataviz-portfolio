# The final data story

[The Representation Gap: Diversity in TV vs. Audience Demand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-representation-gap-diversity-in-tv-vs-audience-demand/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Firstly, I clearly defined diversity for the story's specific purpose, focusing on U.S. TV shows with BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) leading characters and actors in scripted series for adult audiences on network television or streaming platforms. The definition provides a clear scope for the research and helps readers understand the specific context of diversity being discussed.

To emphasize the representation gap more effectively, I began with a prompt encouraging viewers to think about their recent favorite shows. This interactive element aims to engage the audience personally, making them reflect on the diversity (or lack thereof) in their own media consumption habits. By starting with this prompt, it sets the stage for the discussion of the gap between audience preferences and actual representation.

I also reorganized the presentation of data, moving the impactful data point about ratings being 2.6 times higher for diverse shows to the beginning setup. This strategic placement of a powerful statistic early in the content serves to immediately capture the reader's attention and underscore the importance of diversity in TV programming from both a social and business perspective.

Lastly, I removed copyrighted photos. This was due to the requirements of the assignment but also to focus more on the data and text content emphasizing the study's findings.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My main target audience are television industry professionals, mostly producers and network executives. Insights from the interview allowed me to narrow down my story in the hopes of reaching decision-makers in the television industry who can influence greenlighting productions, casting, and other content development choices. By targeting this group, the call to action became more specific, which can effectively nudge the target toward more informed and immediate action which could potentially inspire changes in the industry to improve representation.


## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

Additionally, for the graph depicting diversity perception I chose yellow to green colors. Yellow is often associated with optimism, positivity, and clarity, making it an effective choice to represent positive attitudes towards diversity. This color gradient from yellow to green may also evoke a sense of progress and improvement, subtly reinforcing the message that diversity is viewed positively. These colors are also generally easy to distinguish and provide good contrast, ensuring the data is clearly visible and interpretable. The use of this color scheme not only makes the graph visually appealing but also psychologically reinforces the positive perception of diversity through color associations.

The website strategically employs boldface and quotation marks to create visual impact and emphasize key points throughout the content. **Bold text** is used to highlight crucial statistics, such as "2.6 times higher" when referring to the ratings of diverse shows, immediately drawing the reader's attention to these significant figures. Quotation marks are utilized to set apart specific terms or phrases, giving them added emphasis and clarity. This typographic technique helps to break up the text, making it more scannable and allowing important information to stand out. By using these formatting elements, the website effectively guides the reader's eye to essential data and concepts, enhancing the overall readability and impact of the information presented about diversity in television representation.

## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## AI acknowledgements
> If you used AI to help you complete this assignment (within the parameters of the instruction and course guidelines), detail your use of AI for this assignment here.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

The decision to remove copyrighted photos from the website, while potentially necessary for legal reasons, did come with some limitations. Without visual representations, I thought the story lost some of its immediate appeal and ability to quickly engage viewers. Especially with my beginning prompt, photos of the shows could provide context, incite recognizability, and illustrate diversity in a way that text and data visualizations cannot. Their absence potentially makes it more challenging for some readers to connect with the content on a personal level or to visualize the diversity (or lack thereof) being discussed. I also think that the removal of images could potentially reduce the website's shareability on social media platforms, where visual content often performs better and awareness could increase. However, I admit that this limitation allows for a more professional feel and also presents an opportunity for the website to focus more intently on its data visualization and textual content, leading to a cleaner, more concise presentation of the research findings on the representation gap in television.
