# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
**Diverse ethnic and racial representation on the screen leads to successful TV series**
As a reader I want to know that such series are doing well so that I can advocate for more diversity in representation on screen. I can do this by green lighting such productions.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

Set up 
- success of shows with diverse representation, define standard of ‘diversity’

Conflict 
- compare ethnicity ratios of US population, Netflix users to ratio of shows with diversity within content library

Resolution
- compare 

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.
